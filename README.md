## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

This page was designed to look good **on dark mode**, try it!

I'm an experienced coder who is interested in a lot of things related to AWS, DevSecOps, Developer Experience (DX) and programming and who's got a lot of fingers in a lot of different pies. I'm a generalist to get the big picture of all things coding. A jack-of-all-trades, if you will.

### A bit about me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve recently taken a career break and working am now at a startup.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also expanding my knowldge in Flutter, Firebase and a few others. 

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on real-world problems and hope to make a lasting impact in the STEM community.

- ðŸ¤” **I try to contribute to open-source/FOSS projects daily**, so if you run across something interesting, or you need some help, let me know.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to my coding skills. I can also direct you to free, reputed FOSS resources online to learn in-demand tech skills these days!
